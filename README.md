# Daily Tracker

A simple app to track several categories of daily and/or weekly activities

## Project Status

Daily Tracker 1.0 is ready to go. Currenty the app is setup to track four categories of daily activities: daily pushups, daily situps, whether I've gone for a run on the day, and whether I consumed alcohol on the day.

It presents daily data in a couple of ways: on the CalendarView view, the four data are shown in quadrants. The Pushup and Situp quadrants dynamically change background color based on how close to my rep goal I've gotten to on the day, as well as showing the rep number. The run and alcohol quadrants display an icon depending on if I've run or consumed alcohol, respectively:
